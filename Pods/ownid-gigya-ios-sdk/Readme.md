# OwnID Gigya-iOS SDK

The OwnID Gigya-iOS SDK integrates with Email/Password-based [Gigya Authentication](https://github.com/SAP/gigya-swift-sdk) for apps that do not use Screen-Sets. If your app uses Gigya Screen-Sets, you should use the OwnID Gigya-Screen-Sets iOS SDK instead. For instructions, see the **[Gigya-Screen-Sets guide](sdk-gigya-screens-doc.md)**.

The OwnID Gigya-iOS SDK is a client library written in Swift that provides a passwordless login alternative for your iOS application by using cryptographic keys to replace the traditional password. Integrating the SDK with your iOS app adds a Skip Password option to its registration and login screens.

## Before You Begin
Before incorporating OwnID into your iOS app, you must create an OwnID application and integrate it with your Gigya project. For step-by-step instructions, see [OwnID-Gigya Integration Basics](gigya-integration-basics.md).

In addition, ensure you have done everything to [add Gigya authentication to your iOS project](https://github.com/SAP/gigya-swift-sdk).

## Add Package Dependency
The SDK is distributed via Cocoapods. Use the Cocoapods to add the following package dependency to your project:

```
pod 'ownid-gigya-ios-sdk'
```

## Add Property List File to Project

When the application starts, the OwnID SDK automatically reads `OwnIDConfiguration.plist` from the file system to configure the default instance that is created. At a minimum, this PLIST file defines a redirection URI and unique app id. Create `OwnIDConfiguration.plist` and define the following mandatory parameters:

[Complete example](https://github.com/OwnID/ownid-ios-sdk-demo/blob/master/GigyaDemo/OwnIDConfiguration.plist)
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	<key>OwnIDRedirectionURL</key>
	<string>com.myapp.demo://bazco</string>
	<key>OwnIDAppID</key>
	<string>4tb9nt6iaur0zv</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```
Where:

- The `OwnIDAppID` is the unique AppID, which you can obtain from the [OwnID Console](https://console.ownid.com).
- The `OwnIDRedirectionURL` is the full redirection URL, including its custom scheme. This URL custom scheme must match the one that you defined in your target.

## Create URL Type (Custom URL Scheme)
You need to open your project and create a new URL type that corresponds to the redirection URL specified in `OwnIDConfiguration.plist`. In Xcode, go to **Info > URL Types**, and then use the **URL Schemes** field to specify the redirection URL. For example, if the value of the `OwnIDRedirectionURL` key is `com.myapp.demo://bazco`, then you could copy `com.myapp.demo` and paste it into the **URL Schemes** field.

## Import OwnID Module
Once you have added the OwnID package dependency, you need to import the OwnID module so you can access the SDK features. As you implement OwnID in your project, add the following to your source files:

[Complete example](https://github.com/OwnID/ownid-ios-sdk-demo/blob/master/GigyaDemo/RegisterViewModel.swift)
```swift
import OwnIDGigyaSDK
```

## Initialize the SDK
The OwnID SDK must be initialized properly using the `configure()` function, preferably in the main entry point of your app (in the `@main` `App` struct). For example, enter:

[Complete example](https://github.com/OwnID/ownid-ios-sdk-demo/blob/master/GigyaDemo/GigyaDemoApp.swift)
```swift
@main
struct ExampleApp: App {
    init() {
        OwnID.GigyaSDK.configure()
    }
}
```

If you did not follow the recommendation for creating the `OwnIDConfiguration.plist` file, you need to specify arguments when calling the `configure` function. For details, see [Alternative Syntax for Configure Function](#alternative-syntax-for-configure-function-).

## Implement the Registration Screen
Within a Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture pattern, adding the Skip Password option to your registration screen is as easy as adding an OwnID view model and subscription to your app's ViewModel layer, then adding the OwnID view to your main View. That's it! When the user selects Skip Password, your app waits for events while the user interacts with the OwnID Web App, then calls a function to register the user once they have completed the Skip Password process.

**Important:** When a user registers with OwnID, a random password is generated and set for the user's Gigya account.

### Customize View Model
The OwnID view that inserts the Skip Password UI is bound to an instance of the OwnID view model. Before modifying your View layer, create an instance of this view model, `OwnID.FlowsSDK.RegisterView.ViewModel`, within your ViewModel layer:

[Complete example](https://github.com/OwnID/ownid-ios-sdk-demo/blob/master/GigyaDemo/RegisterViewModel.swift)
```swift
final class MyRegisterViewModel: ObservableObject {
    // MARK: OwnID
    let ownIDViewModel = OwnID.GigyaSDK.registrationViewModel(instance: <Your Instance Of Gigya>)
}
```

After creating this OwnID view model, your View Model layer should listen to events from the OwnID Event Publisher, which allows your app to know what actions to take based on the user's interaction with the OwnID Web App. Simply add the following to your existing ViewModel layer to subscribe to the OwnID Event Publisher and respond to events (it can be placed just after the code that creates the OwnID view model instance).

[Complete example](https://github.com/OwnID/ownid-ios-sdk-demo/blob/master/GigyaDemo/RegisterViewModel.swift)

```swift
final class MyRegisterViewModel: ObservableObject {
    // MARK: OwnID
    let ownIDViewModel = OwnID.GigyaSDK.registrationViewModel(instance: <Your Instance Of Gigya>)

    init() {
     subscribe(to: ownIDViewModel.eventPublisher)
    }

     func subscribe(to eventsPublisher: OwnID.RegistrationPublisher) {
       eventsPublisher
           .receive(on: DispatchQueue.main)
           .sink { [unowned self] event in
               switch event {
               case .success(let event):
                   switch event {
                   // Event when user successfully
                   // finishes Skip Password
                   // in OwnID Web App
                   case .readyToRegister:
                     // If needed, ask user to enter
                     // email (mandatory) and call
                     // OwnID.FlowsSDK.RegisterView.ViewModel.
                     // register(with email: String)
                     // to finish registration.
                     // To pass additional parameters,
                     // such as first name, use
                     // the same approach as in Gigya
                     let nameValue = "{ \"firstName\": \"\(firstName)\" }"
                     let paramsDict = ["profile": nameValue]
                     let params = OwnID.GigyaSDK.Registration.Parameters(parameters: paramsDict)
                     ownIDViewModel.register(with: email, registerParameters: params)

                   // Event when OwnID creates Gigya
                   // account and logs in user
                   case .userRegisteredAndLoggedIn:
                     // User is registered and logged in with OwnID

                   case .loading:
                     // Display loading indicator according to your designs
		     
		   case .resetTapped:
 		     // User tapped activeted button. Rest any data if
 		     // needed. 
                   }

               case .failure(let error):
                // Handle OwnID.CoreSDK.Error here
                // For an example of handling an interruption,
                // see Errors section of this doc
               }
           }
           .store(in: &bag)
   }
}
```

We recommend showing tooltip for user when valid email is entered. Tooltip is kind of popup that gives hint for user to use OwnID button. You can use your own email validation, along with custom logic how to show this suggestion popup.

For example, when user entered valid email, we use binding in OwnID view model to display tooltip.

[Complete example](https://github.com/OwnID/ownid-ios-sdk-demo/blob/master/GigyaDemo/RegisterViewModel.swift)
```swift
// recommended approach is to subscribe to publised property of email and use 
// .removeDuplicates() along with .debounce
ownIDViewModel.shouldShowTooltip = ownIDViewModel.shouldShowTooltipEmailProcessingClosure(emailValue)
//...
```

**Important:** The OwnID `ownIDViewModel.register` function must be called in response to the `.readyToRegister` event. This `ownIDViewModel.register` function eventually calls the standard Gigya function `createUser(withEmail: password:)` to register the user in Gigya, so you do not need to call this Gigya function yourself.

### Add the OwnID View
Inserting the OwnID view into your View layer results in the OwnID button appearing in your app. When the user selects OwnID button, the SDK presents in app Safari browser to interact with the user. The code that creates this view accepts the OwnID view model as its argument. It is suggested that you pass user's email binding for properly creating accounts.

It is reccomended to set height of button the same as text field and disable text field when OwnID is enabled. 

[Complete example](https://github.com/OwnID/ownid-ios-sdk-demo/blob/master/GigyaDemo/RegisterView.swift)
```swift
//Put RegisterView inside your main view, preferably besides password field
var body: some View {
    OwnID.GigyaSDK.createRegisterView(viewModel: viewModel.ownIDViewModel, email: usersEmail)
}
```

## Implement the Login Screen
The process of implementing your Login screen is very similar to the one used to implement the Registration screen. When the user selects Skip Password on the Login screen and if the user has previously set up OwnID authentication, allows them to log in with OwnID.

Like the Registration screen, you add Skip Password to your application's Login screen by including an OwnID view. In this case, it is `OwnID.LoginView`. This OwnID view has its own view model, `OwnID.LoginView.ViewModel`.

### Customize View Model
You need to create an instance of the view model, `OwnID.LoginView.ViewModel`, that the OwnID login view uses. Within your ViewModel layer, enter:

[Complete example](https://github.com/OwnID/ownid-ios-sdk-demo/blob/master/GigyaDemo/LogInViewModel.swift)
```swift
final class MyLogInViewModel: ObservableObject {
    // MARK: OwnID
    let ownIDViewModel = OwnID.GigyaSDK.loginViewModel(instance: <Your Instance Of Gigya>)
}
```

After creating this OwnID view model, your View Model layer should listen to events from the OwnID Event Publisher, which allows your app to know what actions to take based on the user's interaction with the Skip Password option. Simply add the following to your existing ViewModel layer to subscribe to the OwnID Event Publisher and respond to events.

[Complete example](https://github.com/OwnID/ownid-ios-sdk-demo/blob/master/GigyaDemo/LogInViewModel.swift)
```swift
final class MyLogInViewModel: ObservableObject {
    // MARK: OwnID
    let ownIDViewModel = OwnID.GigyaSDK.loginViewModel(instance: <Your Instance Of Gigya>)

     init() {
       subscribe(to: ownIDViewModel.eventPublisher)
     }

     func subscribe(to eventsPublisher: OwnID.LoginPublisher) {
       eventsPublisher
           .receive(on: DispatchQueue.main)
           .sink { [unowned self] event in
               switch event {
               case .success(let event):
                   switch event {
                   // Event when user who previously set up
                   // OwnID logs in with Skip Password
                   case .loggedIn:
                     // User is logged in with OwnID
                     
                   case .loading:
                     // Display loading indicator according to your designs
                   }

               case .failure(let error):
                 // Handle OwnID.CoreSDK.Error here
               }
           }
           .store(in: &bag)
   }
}
```

### Add OwnID View
Inserting the OwnID view into your View layer results in the Skip Password option appearing in your app. When the user selects Skip Password, the SDK opens a sheet to interact with the user. It is recommended that you place the OwnID view, `OwnID.LoginView`, immediately after the password text field. The code that creates this view accepts the OwnID view model as its argument. It is suggested that you pass user's email binding for properly creating accounts.

[Complete example](https://github.com/OwnID/ownid-ios-sdk-demo/blob/master/GigyaDemo/LogInView.swift)
```swift
//Put LoginView inside your main view, preferably below password field
var body: some View {
  //...
  // User's email binding `$viewModel.email` is used to display identity
  // name when logging in. Additionally, this email is used to get
  // information if user already has OwnID account
  OwnID.GigyaSDK.createLoginView(viewModel: viewModel.ownIDViewModel,
                                 usersEmail: $viewModel.email)
  //...
}
```

By default, tooltip popup will appear every time login view is shown.
Use `shouldShowTooltip` to disable tooltip appear of tooltip completely. To do this, use assign `false`.

## Errors
All errors from the SDK have an `OwnID.CoreSDK.Error` type. You can use them, for example, to properly ask the user to perform an action.

Here are some of the possible errors:

[Complete example](https://github.com/OwnID/ownid-core-ios-sdk/blob/master/Core/Sources/Types/CoreError.swift)
```swift
switch error {
case .unsecuredHttpPassed:
    print("unsecuredHttpPassed")

case .notValidRedirectionURLOrNotMatchingFromConfiguration:
    print("notValidRedirectionURLOrNotMatchingFromConfiguration")

case .emailIsInvalid:
    print("emailIsInvalid")

case .flowCancelled:
    print("flowCancelled")

case .statusRequestResponseIsEmpty:
    print("statusRequestResponseIsEmpty")

case .statusRequestFail(underlying: let underlying):
    print("statusRequestFail: \(underlying)")

case .plugin(let pluginError):
    print("plugin: \(pluginError)")
}
```

### Handling Gigya Request Data
The following example shows how to get request data from the Gigya SDK if an error occurred

[Complete example](https://github.com/OwnID/ownid-ios-sdk-demo/blob/master/GigyaDemo/LogInViewModel.swift)
```swift
case .failure(let error):
    switch error {
    case .plugin(let gigyaPluginError):
        if let error = gigyaPluginError as? OwnID.GigyaSDK.Error {
            switch error {
            case .gigyaSDKError(let networkError, let dataDictionary):
                switch networkError {
                case .gigyaError(let model):
                    //handling the data
                    print(dataDictionary)
                    print(model.errorMessage)
                default: break
                }
            default:
                break
            }
        }

    default:
        break
    }
```        

## Advanced Configuration

### Button Apperance
It is possible to set button visual settings by passing `OwnID.UISDK.VisualLookConfig`. Additionally, you can override default behaviour of tooltip appearing or other settings in `OwnID.UISDK.TooltipVisualLookConfig`.
By passing `widgetPosition`, `or` text view will change it's position accordingly.

```swift
let tooltipConfig = OwnID.UISDK.TooltipVisualLookConfig(backgroundColor: .pink,
                                                        borderColor: .accentColor)
let config = OwnID.UISDK.VisualLookConfig(biometryIconColor: .red,
                                          shadowColor: .cyan,
                                          tooltipVisualLookConfig: tooltipConfig, 
					  widgetPosition: .start)
OwnID.GigyaSDK.createLoginView(viewModel: ownIDViewModel,
                               usersEmail: usersEmail,
                               visualConfig: config)
```

### Alternative Syntax for Configure Function ðŸŽ›
If you followed the recommendation to add `OwnIDConfiguration.plist` to your project, calling `configure()` without any arguments is enough to initialize the SDK. If you did not follow this recommendation, you can still initialize the SDK with one of the following calls. Remember that these calls should be made within your app's `@main` `App` struct.

* `OwnID.GigyaSDK.configure(plistUrl: plist)` explicitly provides the path to the OwnID configuration file, where `plist` is the path to the file.
* `OwnID.GigyaSDK.configure(appID: String, redirectionURL: URL)` explicitly defines the configuration options rather than using a PLIST file. The server app id is unique to your OwnID application, and can be obtained in the [OwnID Console](https://console.ownid.com). The redirection URL is your app's redirection URL, including its custom scheme.

### OwnID Web App language

By default, the OwnID Web App is launched with a language TAGs list (well-formed [IETF BCP 47 language tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Language)) based on the device locales set by the user in system. You can override this behavior and set the Web App language list manually by passing languages in an array. Example:

```swift
OwnID.GigyaSDK.createRegisterView(viewModel: viewModel.ownIDViewModel,
                                  webLanguages: OwnID.CoreSDK.Languages.init(rawValue: ["he"]))
```


## Manually Invoke OwnID Flow
As alternative to OwnID button it is possible to use custom view to call functionality. In a nutshell, here it is the same behaviour from `ownIDViewModel`, just with your custom view provided.

Create simple `PassthroughSubject`. After you created custom view, on press send void action through this `PassthroughSubject`. In your `viewModel`, make `ownIDViewModel` to subscribe to this newly created publisher.

[Complete example](https://github.com/OwnID/ownid-demo-ios-sdk/blob/master/ownid-demo-components-ios/DemoAppComponents/LoggedOut/LogIn/LogInView.swift)

```swift
ownIDViewModel.subscribe(to: self.buttonPressedPublisher.eraseToAnyPublisher())
```

[Complete example](https://github.com/OwnID/ownid-demo-ios-sdk/blob/master/ownid-demo-components-ios/DemoAppComponents/LoggedOut/LogIn/LogInViewModel.swift)

Good practice is to pass closure to `ownIDViewModel` for it to be able to pass email down to web app. Assign email closure:

```swift
ownIDViewModel.getEmail = { self.email }
```

Additionally you can reset view by calling `ownIDViewModel.resetState()`.



## Logging
You can enable console logging by calling `OwnID.startDebugConsoleLogger()`.

      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
